In this chapter, we delve into the implementation of the @Fama1973 regression approach, a cornerstone of empirical asset pricing. While portfolio sorts provide a robust, non-parametric view of the relationship between characteristics and returns, they struggle when we need to control for multiple factors simultaneously. For instance, in the Vietnamese stock market (HOSE and HNX), small-cap stocks often exhibit high illiquidity. Does the "Size effect" exist because small stocks are risky, or simply because they are illiquid? Fama-MacBeth (FM) regressions allow us to disentangle these effects in a linear framework.

We will implement a version of the FM procedure, accounting for:
1.  **Weighted Least Squares (WLS):** To prevent micro-cap stocks, which are prevalent and volatile in Vietnam, from dominating the estimates.
2.  **Newey-West Adjustments:** To handle the serial correlation often observed in Vietnamese market risk premiums.
3.  **Shanken Correction:** To mathematically adjust for the "Errors-in-Variables" bias arising from estimated betas.

## The Econometric Framework

The Fama-MacBeth procedure is essentially a two-step filter that separates the cross-sectional variation in returns from the time-series variation.

### Intuition: Why not Panel OLS?

A naive approach would be to pool all data ($N$ stocks $\times$ $T$ months) and run a single Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression:

$$ 
r_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \beta_{i,t} \lambda + \epsilon_{i,t+1} 
$$

However, this assumes that the error terms $\epsilon_{i,t+1}$ are independent across firms. In reality, stock returns are highly cross-sectionally correlated (if the VN-Index crashes, most stocks fall together). A pooled OLS would underestimate the standard errors, leading to "false positive" discoveries of risk factors. Fama-MacBeth solves this by running $T$ separate cross-sectional regressions, effectively treating each month as a single independent observation of the risk premium.

### Mathematical Derivation

#### Step 1: Cross-Sectional Regressions

For each month $t$, we estimate the premium $\lambda_{k,t}$ for $K$ factors. Let $r_{i,t+1}$ be the excess return of asset $i$ at time $t+1$. Let $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{i,t}$ be a vector of $K$ characteristics (e.g., Market Beta, Book-to-Market, Size) known at time $t$.

The model for a specific month $t$ is:
$$ 
\mathbf{r}_{t+1} = \mathbf{X}_t \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{t+1} + \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{t+1} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t+1} 
$$

Where:
* $\mathbf{r}_{t+1}$ is an $N \times 1$ vector of returns.
* $\mathbf{X}_t$ is an $N \times (K+1)$ matrix of factor exposures (including a column of ones for the intercept).
* $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{t+1}$ is the vector of risk premiums realized in month $t+1$.

To use **Weighted Least Squares (WLS)**, We define a weighting matrix $\mathbf{W}_t$ (typically diagonal with market capitalizations). The estimator for month $t$ is:
$$ 
\hat{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}_{t+1} = (\mathbf{X}_t^\top \mathbf{W}_t \mathbf{X}_t)^{-1} \mathbf{X}_t^\top \mathbf{W}_t \mathbf{r}_{t+1} 
$$


#### Step 2: Time-Series Aggregation

We now have a time-series of $T$ estimates: $\hat{\lambda}_1, \hat{\lambda}_2, \dots, \hat{\lambda}_T$. The final estimate of the risk premium is the time-series average:
$$ 
\hat{\lambda}_k = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \hat{\lambda}_{k,t} 
$$

The standard error is derived from the standard deviation of these monthly estimates:
$$ 
\sigma(\hat{\lambda}_k) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T^2} \sum_{t=1}^T (\hat{\lambda}_{k,t} - \hat{\lambda}_k)^2} 
$$


## The "Errors-in-Variables" (EIV) Problem
A critical subtlety often ignored in basic applications is that the betas used in Step 1 are not true values, they are estimates from a prior rolling window (Step 0). This measurement error biases the second-pass $\lambda$ estimates (typically downwards) and understates the standard errors.

@Shanken1992 provides a correction factor $c$. If we use standard portfolio betas, the variance of the estimator must be inflated:
$$ 
\sigma^2_{Shanken}(\hat{\lambda}) = \sigma^2_{FM}(\hat{\lambda}) \times (1 + \hat{\lambda}^\top \Sigma_f^{-1} \hat{\lambda}) 
$$

Where $\Sigma_f$ is the covariance matrix of the factors. This correction is particularly relevant for the Vietnamese market where factor volatilities are high, making the term $(1 + \dots)$ significantly larger than 1.

## Data Preparation

We utilize data from our local SQLite database. In Vietnam, the fiscal year typically ends in December, and audited reports are required by April. To ensure no look-ahead bias, we lag accounting data (Book Equity) to match returns starting in July (a 6-month conservative lag, similar to Fama-French, but adapted for Vietnamese reporting delays).

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sqlite3
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import statsmodels.api as sm
from pandas.tseries.offsets import MonthEnd

# Connect to the Vietnamese data
tidy_finance = sqlite3.connect(database="data/tidy_finance_python.sqlite")

# Load Monthly Prices (HOSE & HNX)
prices_monthly = pd.read_sql_query(
  sql="SELECT symbol, date, ret_excess, mktcap FROM prices_monthly",
  con=tidy_finance,
  parse_dates={"date"}
)

# Load Book Equity (derived from Vietnamese Financial Statements)
comp_vn = pd.read_sql_query(
  sql="SELECT datadate, symbol, be FROM comp_vn",
  con=tidy_finance,
  parse_dates={"datadate"}
)

# Load Rolling Market Betas (Pre-calculated in Chapter 'Beta Estimation')
beta_monthly = pd.read_sql_query(
  sql="SELECT symbol, date, beta FROM beta_monthly WHERE return_type = 'monthly'",
  con=tidy_finance,
  parse_dates={"date"}
)
```

We construct our testing characteristics:

1. **(Market Beta):** The sensitivity to the VN-Index.
2. **Size (ln(ME)):** The natural log of market capitalization.
3. **Value (BM):** The ratio of Book Equity to Market Equity.

```{python}
# Prepare Characteristics
characteristics = (
    comp_vn
    # Align reporting date to month end
    .assign(date=lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x["datadate"]) + MonthEnd(0))
    # Merge with price data to get Market Cap at fiscal year end
    .merge(prices_monthly, on=["symbol", "date"], how="left")
    .merge(beta_monthly, on=["symbol", "date"], how="left")
    .assign(
        be_scaled = lambda x: x["be"] / 1_000_000, 
        # Compute Book-to-Market
        bm=lambda x: x["be_scaled"] / x["mktcap"],
        log_mktcap=lambda x: np.log(x["mktcap"]),
        # Create sorting date: Financials valid from July of year t+1
        sorting_date=lambda x: x["date"] + pd.DateOffset(months=6) + MonthEnd(0),
    )
    .get(["symbol", "bm", "beta", "sorting_date"]) 
    .dropna()
)

characteristics.head()
```


```{python}
# Merge back to monthly return panel
data_fm = (prices_monthly
  .merge(characteristics, 
         left_on=["symbol", "date"], 
         right_on=["symbol", "sorting_date"], 
         how="left")
#   .merge(beta_monthly, on=["symbol", "date"], how="left")
  .sort_values(["symbol", "date"])
)

# Forward fill characteristics for 12 months (valid until next report)
data_fm[["bm"]] = data_fm.groupby("symbol")[["bm"]].ffill(limit=12)

# Log Market Cap is updated monthly
data_fm["log_mktcap"] = np.log(data_fm["mktcap"])

# Lead returns: We use characteristics at t to predict return at t+1
data_fm["ret_excess_lead"] = data_fm.groupby("symbol")["ret_excess"].shift(-1)

# Cleaning: Remove rows with missing future returns or characteristics
data_fm = data_fm.dropna(subset=["ret_excess_lead", "beta", "log_mktcap", "bm"])

print(data_fm.head())

print(f"Data ready: {len(data_fm):,} observations from {data_fm.date.min().date()} to {data_fm.date.max().date()}")

```

## Step 1: Cross-Sectional Regressions with WLS

@Hou2020 argue that micro-cap stocks distorts inference because they have high transaction costs and idiosyncratic volatility. In Vietnam, this is exacerbated by "penny stock" speculation.

We implement **Weighted Least Squares (WLS)** where weights are the market capitalization of the prior month. This tests if the factors are priced in the *investable* universe, not just the equal-weighted average of tiny stocks.

```{python}
def run_cross_section(df):
    # Standardize inputs for numerical stability
    # Note: We do NOT standardize the dependent variable (returns)
    # We standardize regressors to interpret coefficients as "per 1 SD change" if desired,
    # BUT for pure risk premium estimation, we usually keep raw units.
    # Here we use raw units to interpret lambda as % return per unit of characteristic.
    
    # Define Weighted Least Squares
    model = smf.wls(
        formula="ret_excess_lead ~ beta + log_mktcap + bm",
        data=df,
        weights=df["mktcap"] # Weight by size
    )
    results = model.fit()
    
    return results.params

# Apply to every month
risk_premiums = (data_fm
  .groupby("date")
  .apply(run_cross_section)
  .reset_index()
)

print(risk_premiums.head())

```

## Step 2: Time-Series Aggregation & Hypothesis Testing

We now possess the time-series of risk premiums. We calculate the arithmetic mean and the -statistics.

Crucially, we use **Newey-West (HAC)** standard errors. Risk premiums in Vietnam often exhibit autocorrelation (momentum in factor performance). A simple standard error formula would be invalid.

```{python}
def calculate_fama_macbeth_stats(df, lags=6):
    summary = []
    
    for col in ["Intercept", "beta", "log_mktcap", "bm"]:
        series = df[col]
        
        # 1. Point Estimate (Average Risk Premium)
        mean_premium = series.mean()
        
        # 2. Newey-West Standard Error
        # We regress the series on a constant (ones) to get the SE of the mean
        exog = sm.add_constant(np.ones(len(series)))
        nw_model = sm.OLS(series, exog).fit(
            cov_type='HAC', cov_kwds={'maxlags': lags}
        )

        se = nw_model.bse.iloc[0]
        t_stat = nw_model.tvalues.iloc[0]
        
        summary.append({
            "Factor": col,
            "Premium (%)": mean_premium * 100,
            "Std Error": se * 100,
            "t-statistic": t_stat,
            "Significance": "*" if abs(t_stat) > 1.96 else ""
        })
        
    return pd.DataFrame(summary)

price_of_risk = calculate_fama_macbeth_stats(risk_premiums)
print(price_of_risk.round(4))
```

### Visualizing the Time-Varying Risk Premium

One major advantage of the FM approach is that we can inspect the volatility of the risk premiums over time. In Vietnam, we expect the "Size" premium to be highly volatile during periods of retail liquidity injection (e.g., 2020-2021).

```{python}
#| label: fig-cumulative-premiums
#| fig-alt: "A line plot displaying the time series of cumulative risk premiums for three factors: beta, log_mktcap, and bm in the Vietnamese market. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the cumulative coefficient returns."
#| fig-cap: "Cumulative Risk Premiums in Vietnam."

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.ticker as mtick

# Calculate cumulative returns of the factors (as if they were tradable portfolios)
cumulative_premiums = (risk_premiums
    .set_index("date")
    .drop(columns=["Intercept"])
    .cumsum()
)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
cumulative_premiums.plot(ax=ax, linewidth=2)
ax.set_title("Cumulative Risk Premiums in Vietnam (Fama-MacBeth)", fontsize=14)
ax.set_ylabel("Cumulative Coefficient Return")
ax.legend(title="Factor")
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()

```


1. **Market Beta:** In many empirical studies (including the US), the market beta premium is often insignificant or even negative (the "Betting Against Beta" anomaly). In Vietnam, if the -stat is , it implies the CAPM does not explain the cross-section of returns.
2. **Size (Log Mktcap):** A negative coefficient confirms the "Size Effect"—smaller firms have higher expected returns. However, using WLS often weakens this result compared to OLS, suggesting the size premium is concentrated in micro-caps.
3. **Value (BM):** A positive coefficient confirms the Value premium. In Vietnam, value stocks (high B/M) often outperform growth stocks, particularly in the manufacturing and banking sectors.

## The Shanken Correction

We must adjust the -statistics for the fact that $\beta$ was estimated.

The formula for the -statistic with Shanken correction is:
$$ 
t_{Shanken} = \frac{\hat{\lambda}*k}{\sqrt{\sigma^2*{FM} (1 + c)}} 
$$

where $c = \hat{\lambda}_{factor}^\top \hat{\Sigma}_f^{-1} \hat{\lambda}_{factor}$.

*Note:* Strictly speaking, the Shanken correction applies when the factors are *returns* (like Fama-French factors). When using characteristics (like we do here), the correction is more complex, but the intuition remains: our standard errors are likely too small.


```{python}
#| label: shanken-correction

# 1. Prepare the data
# We drop 'date' and 'Intercept' to focus only on the priced risk factors
factor_columns = ["beta", "log_mktcap", "bm"]
lambda_series = risk_premiums[factor_columns]

# 2. Calculate the inputs
# Mean vector of the risk premiums (lambda_bar)
lambda_bar = lambda_series.mean().values

# Covariance matrix of the risk premiums (Sigma_f)
cov_matrix = lambda_series.cov().values

# 3. Compute the Correction Term c
# c = lambda_bar' * inv(Sigma) * lambda_bar
try:
    c = lambda_bar.T @ np.linalg.inv(cov_matrix) @ lambda_bar
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    # Fallback if matrix is singular (rare in monthly data)
    c = 0 
    print("Warning: Covariance matrix is singular. Shanken correction set to 0.")

print(f"Shanken Correction Term (c): {c:.4f}")

# 4. Apply the Correction to Standard Errors
# We recalculate the summary stats with the adjustment
shanken_summary = []
T = len(risk_premiums)

for col in factor_columns:
    series = risk_premiums[col]
    
    # Standard Fama-MacBeth Variance (Standard Error of the Mean squared)
    # var(mean) = var(series) / T
    fm_variance = series.var() / T
    
    # Adjusted Variance
    shanken_variance = fm_variance * (1 + c)
    
    # Adjusted Standard Error
    shanken_se = np.sqrt(shanken_variance)
    
    # New t-statistic
    estimate = series.mean()
    t_stat_adj = estimate / shanken_se
    
    shanken_summary.append({
        "Factor": col,
        "Premium (%)": estimate * 100,
        "FM Std Error": np.sqrt(fm_variance) * 100,
        "Shanken Std Error": shanken_se * 100,
        "t-stat (Adj)": t_stat_adj,
        "Significance": "*" if abs(t_stat_adj) > 1.96 else ""
    })

shanken_results = pd.DataFrame(shanken_summary)
print(shanken_results.round(4))
```

Looking at the screenshot you provided, there is an immediate red flag that warrants a "sanity check" before you proceed.

In the `bm` (Book-to-Market) row, the Premium is **0.0000** and the Standard Error is **0.0000**, yet the t-statistic is **1.2334**. This mathematical oddity suggests your results are suffering from **rounding issues** or **scaling problems**.

A t-statistic of 1.23 implies the mean is roughly 1.2 times the standard error. For both to appear as zero, the actual values must be vanishingly small (e.g., ), which is economically meaningless or indicates a data unit mismatch.

Here is a professional sanity check protocol to validate your Fama-MacBeth results.

### 1. The "Zero Premium" Inspection

Your `bm` coefficient is likely being displayed as zero because of pandas' default display precision, but the low magnitude itself is suspicious.

**Diagnosis:**
If your returns are in decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5%) and your Book-to-Market ratio is standard (e.g., 1.5), the coefficient should be in the range of 0.002 to 0.02 (0.2% to 2%). If it is 0.0000, either:

1. The `bm` variable has extreme outliers (e.g., a data error where one stock has a `bm` of 1,000,000), which flattens the regression slope.
2. The `bm` variable has no variation (it's constant).

**Action:** Run this check to see the *real* values and distribution.

```{python}
# 1. Increase display precision to see the 'real' numbers
pd.set_option('display.precision', 8)
print(shanken_results)

# 2. Check the raw coefficients for 'bm'
# Are they consistently tiny, or is there one massive outlier distorting the mean?
print(risk_premiums["bm"].describe())

# 3. Check the input data for outliers
# In Vietnam, data errors in Book Value are common
print(data_fama_macbeth["bm"].describe())

```

### 2. Time-Series Volatility Check

Fama-MacBeth relies on the assumption that the risk premium varies over time. If your `bm` premium is truly near zero every month, the method fails.

**Action:** Plot the time series of the estimated coefficients . You want to see "noise" around a mean. If you see a flat line or a single massive spike, your data is corrupted.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the time series of the BM risk premium
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
risk_premiums["bm"].plot(ax=ax, title="Monthly Value Premium (BM) Coefficient")
ax.axhline(0, color="black", linestyle="--")
ax.set_ylabel("Slope Coefficient")
plt.show()

```

### 3. The "Predicted vs. Realized" Scatter Plot

The ultimate test of an asset pricing model is whether it can price the test assets. If you group your stocks into portfolios (e.g., 25 portfolios sorted by Size and Beta), the model's predicted return should match the actual average return.

**Action:** Compare the model's prediction against reality.

1. Calculate the average realized return for each stock .
2. Calculate the predicted return: .
3. Scatter plot them. They should align along the 45-degree line.

```{python}
# Calculate average characteristics for each stock
stock_means = data_fama_macbeth.groupby("symbol")[["ret_excess_lead", "beta", "log_mktcap", "bm"]].mean()

# Calculate Predicted Return using your Shanken results
# Note: Ensure you grab the 'Premium (%)' divided by 100 if it was scaled
# Or use the raw mean from risk_premiums
lambda_beta = risk_premiums["beta"].mean()
lambda_size = risk_premiums["log_mktcap"].mean()
lambda_bm = risk_premiums["bm"].mean()
const = risk_premiums["Intercept"].mean()

stock_means["predicted_ret"] = (
    const +
    stock_means["beta"] * lambda_beta + 
    stock_means["log_mktcap"] * lambda_size + 
    stock_means["bm"] * lambda_bm
)

# Plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
ax.scatter(stock_means["predicted_ret"], stock_means["ret_excess_lead"], alpha=0.3)
ax.plot([0, 0.05], [0, 0.05], color='r', linestyle='--') # 45-degree line
ax.set_xlabel("Predicted Average Return")
ax.set_ylabel("Realized Average Return")
ax.set_title("Model Fit: Predicted vs Realized")
plt.show()

```

### 4. Correlation of Characteristics (Multicollinearity)

In Vietnam, large-cap stocks (high `log_mktcap`) are often the ones with high Book-to-Market ratios (banks/utilities) or specific Betas. If your factors are highly correlated, the Fama-MacBeth coefficients will be unstable and insignificant (low t-stats), even if the factors actually matter.

**Action:** Check the cross-sectional correlation.

```{python}
# Check correlation of the characteristics
corr_matrix = data_fama_macbeth[["beta", "log_mktcap", "bm"]].corr()
print(corr_matrix)

```

**Interpretation:**

* If correlation > 0.7 (absolute value), the regression struggles to distinguish between the two factors.
* For example, if `Size` and `Liquidity` are -0.8 correlated, the model cannot tell which one is driving the return, often resulting in both having insignificant t-stats.

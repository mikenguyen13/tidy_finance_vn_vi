If financial statements merely repackage what the market already knows from other sources, such as press coverage, analyst reports, management guidance, macroeconomic data, then the elaborate apparatus of financial reporting is largely redundant for price discovery. Conversely, if earnings announcements trigger measurable changes in trading behavior, we have evidence that the accounting system produces information the market did not previously possess.\n\n@beaver1968information addressed this question by examining whether trading volume and return volatility increase around the dates when firms announce annual earnings. The logic is direct: if an earnings announcement contains new information, it should alter investors' beliefs. Altered beliefs lead some investors to trade, increasing volume. And to the extent that the announcement resolves uncertainty, the stock price should adjust, generating abnormal return volatility. Both channels (i.e., volume and volatility) provide distinct windows into the information content of earnings.\n\nThe empirical design compares a firm's trading activity during a narrow **announcement window** (the days immediately around the earnings release) with its own trading activity during a **non-announcement window** (otherwise comparable days away from the event). If the announcement conveys information, the announcement window should show elevated volume and volatility relative to the non-announcement period.\n\n### Two Distinct Signals: Volume vs. Volatility\n\nWhile volume and return volatility are both used to measure investor reaction, they capture different economic phenomena. This distinction, formalized in subsequent theoretical work, is important for interpreting results:\n\n-   **Return volatility** reflects the *average* revision in investor beliefs. When the market as a whole is surprised by an earnings number, prices move sharply. The magnitude of the squared (or absolute) return residual measures how far the announcement moved the consensus. This is a measure of the *aggregate information content* of the announcement [@kim1991market].\n\n-   **Trading volume** reflects *disagreement* among investors about the implications of the announcement. Even an announcement that moves prices very little can generate heavy trading if investors interpret the same signal differently. For example, if some view an earnings beat as sustainable while others view it as temporary [@kandel1995differential]. Volume thus captures the *differential information content* of the announcement.\n\n@karpoff1987relation surveys the theoretical and empirical relationship between these two variables. The key insight is that volume is not simply a noisier version of volatility; it provides independent information about how the market processes accounting data.\n\n### Why Vietnam?\n\nVietnam's equity markets provide a distinctive setting for studying announcement reactions for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Information environment.** Vietnamese listed firms face less intense pre-announcement scrutiny than their U.S. counterparts. Analyst coverage is sparse (most firms outside the VN30 index receive no institutional coverage). Management earnings guidance is rare. This creates a thicker \"information gap\" for the earnings announcement to fill, potentially amplifying both volume and volatility reactions.\n\n2.  **Retail investor dominance.** Over 80% of daily trading volume on HOSE is attributed to retail investors. Retail traders may process earnings information differently from institutions, with greater behavioral biases, less capacity for fundamental analysis, and different trading horizons. This affects both the timing and magnitude of market reactions.\n\n3.  **Price limits.** HOSE imposes daily price limits of $\\pm$ 7% and HNX of $\\pm$ 10%. When an earnings announcement is sufficiently surprising, the stock may hit its price limit, preventing the market from fully incorporating the information within a single trading session. This creates a distinctive pattern of *multi-day adjustment* that has no analogue in the original U.S. studies.\n\n4.  **Disclosure timing.** Vietnamese regulations require audited annual financial statements to be published within 90 days of fiscal year-end. Quarterly financial data (unaudited) must be released within 20 days. The overlap between quarterly and annual announcements, and the variable lag between fiscal year-end and announcement date, creates heterogeneity in the information content of annual earnings releases.\n\n5.  **Market structure.** Vietnam operates continuous order-matching during trading hours (9:00–11:30 and 13:00–14:30 on HOSE; 9:00–11:30 and 13:00–15:00 on HNX), with periodic call auctions at open and close. This microstructure affects intraday patterns of price discovery around announcements.\n\n## Theoretical Framework {#sec-info-earnings-theory}\n\n### The Information Content Hypothesis\n\nLet $P_{i,t}$ denote the price of stock $i$ on date $t$. Under the efficient markets hypothesis, the price reflects all publicly available information:\n\n$$\nP_{i,t} = E\\left[\\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{D_{i,t+s}}{(1+r)^s} \\;\\bigg|\\; \\Omega_t \\right]\n$$ {#eq-emh}\n\nwhere $D_{i,t+s}$ represents future dividends, $r$ is the discount rate, and $\\Omega_t$ is the information set at time $t$.\n\nWhen firm $i$ announces earnings $X_i$ at time $\\tau$, the information set expands: $\\Omega_{\\tau^+} = \\Omega_{\\tau^-} \\cup \\{X_i\\}$. If the announcement contains new information, meaning $X_i \\notin \\Omega_{\\tau^-}$, then in general:\n\n$$\nP_{i,\\tau^+} \\neq P_{i,\\tau^-}\n$$ {#eq-price-revision}\n\nThe magnitude of the price change reflects the *surprise* component of the announcement:\n\n$$\n|P_{i,\\tau^+} - P_{i,\\tau^-}| \\propto |X_i - E[X_i | \\Omega_{\\tau^-}]|\n$$ {#eq-surprise}\n\n### Volume as a Signal of Heterogeneous Beliefs\n\n@kim1991market develop a model where trading volume is driven by the precision of investors' private information relative to the precision of the public signal. Define $V_{i,\\tau}$ as the trading volume for stock $i$ at time $\\tau$. In their framework:\n\n$$\nV_{i,\\tau} = f\\left(\\frac{\\text{Var}[X_i | \\Omega^{(j)}_{\\tau^-}]}{\\text{Var}[\\varepsilon_i]}\\right)\n$$ {#eq-volume-model}\n\nwhere $\\Omega^{(j)}_{\\tau^-}$ is investor $j$'s private information set and $\\varepsilon_i$ is noise. Volume increases when investors disagree about what the announcement means, a condition that @kandel1995differential term **differential interpretation**.\n\nThis distinction matters for Vietnam. In a market dominated by retail investors with heterogeneous information and analytical capacity, we might expect the volume reaction to be *disproportionately large* relative to the price reaction, because disagreement is high even when the aggregate price revision is modest.\n\n### Measuring Information Content\n\nWe use two complementary measures:\n\n**Abnormal return volatility.** For each firm-day, compute the squared market-adjusted return:\n\n$$\nU^2_{i,t} = (R_{i,t} - R_{m,t})^2\n$$ {#eq-squared-residual}\n\nwhere $R_{i,t}$ is the return on stock $i$ and $R_{m,t}$ is the market return. Under the null of no information content, $E[U^2_{i,t}]$ should be the same in the announcement and non-announcement windows. @beaver1968information standardized this measure by dividing by the firm's average $U^2$ during non-announcement weeks.\n\n**Relative volume.** For each firm-day, compute:\n\n$$\nRV_{i,t} = \\frac{Vol_{i,t}}{\\overline{Vol}_i}\n$$ {#eq-relative-volume}\n\nwhere $\\overline{Vol}_i$ is the firm's average daily volume over the event window. A value of $RV > 1$ indicates above-average trading. @beaver1968information used a similar approach, computing a \"volume ratio\" relative to non-report-period averages.\n\n## Data and Variable Construction {#sec-info-earnings-measures}\n\n### Data Requirements\n\nThe analysis requires three data elements:\n\n| Data | Source | Key Fields |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Earnings announcement dates | Financial statements/filings | Ticker, fiscal year-end, announcement date |\n| Daily stock returns | Exchange data (HOSE/HNX) | Ticker, date, closing price, return |\n| Daily trading volume | Exchange data (HOSE/HNX) | Ticker, date, volume (shares or VND) |\n\n: Data sources for the information content analysis {#tbl-info-earnings-data-sources}\n\n### Trading Day Calendar\n\nA critical infrastructure element is a **trading day calendar** that maps calendar dates to sequential trading day indices. This allows us to count \"20 trading days before the announcement\" correctly, skipping weekends and holidays.\n\n::: {#trading-calendar .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-summary=\"Construct a trading day calendar for HOSE/HNX\"}\ndef build_trading_calendar(\n    start_date: str = \"2008-01-01\",\n    end_date: str = \"2024-12-31\",\n) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    \"\"\"\n    Build a trading day calendar for Vietnamese stock exchanges.\n    \n    Vietnamese exchanges trade Monday–Friday, with closures for:\n    - Tết Nguyên Đán (Lunar New Year, ~5 days)\n    - Ngày Giỗ Tổ Hùng Vương (Hung Kings' Commemoration)\n    - Ngày Giải phóng miền Nam (Reunification Day, Apr 30)\n    - Ngày Quốc tế Lao động (Labour Day, May 1)\n    - Quốc khánh (National Day, Sep 2)\n    - Tết Dương lịch (New Year, Jan 1)\n    \n    For simulation, we approximate by removing weekends and ~10 holidays/year.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_dates = pd.date_range(start_date, end_date, freq=\"B\")  # business days\n    \n    # Remove approximate Vietnamese public holidays\n    # (In practice, use the exact holiday calendar from SSC/HOSE)\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    n_holidays_per_year = 10\n    years = all_dates.year.unique()\n    holidays = []\n    for yr in years:\n        yr_dates = all_dates[all_dates.year == yr]\n        if len(yr_dates) > n_holidays_per_year:\n            idx = rng.choice(len(yr_dates), n_holidays_per_year, replace=False)\n            holidays.extend(yr_dates[idx])\n    \n    trading_dates = all_dates.difference(pd.DatetimeIndex(holidays))\n    \n    cal = pd.DataFrame({\n        \"date\": trading_dates,\n        \"td\": np.arange(1, len(trading_dates) + 1),\n    })\n    return cal\n\ntrading_cal = build_trading_calendar()\nprint(f\"Trading calendar: {len(trading_cal):,} trading days, \"\n      f\"{trading_cal['date'].min().date()} to {trading_cal['date'].max().date()}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrading calendar: 4,266 trading days, 2008-01-01 to 2024-12-31\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Announcement Date Alignment\n\nEarnings announcements may occur on non-trading days (weekends, holidays). When this happens, we assign the announcement to the *next available* trading day, since that is the first opportunity for the market to react. We also need to handle the case where announcements occur after market close. Ideally, these would be assigned to the following trading day. Without intraday timing data (common in Vietnamese disclosures), we use the announcement date as reported.\n\n::: {#annc-date-alignment .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-summary=\"Map announcement dates to trading day indices\"}\ndef build_announcement_mapper(trading_cal: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a mapping from every calendar date to the next available\n    trading day index.

When an announcement is sufficiently surprising, the stock may hit the $\\pm$ 7% limit on HOSE (or $\\pm$ 10% on HNX), and the remaining adjustment spills into subsequent trading days. This creates a pattern of **limit hits followed by continued drift**, a phenomenon that would bias downward any single-day measure of announcement impact and redistribute information content across days 0, +1, and potentially +2.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Identify limit hits\ndef is_limit_hit(row):\n    limit = 0.07 if row[\"exchange\"] == \"HOSE\" else 0.10\n    return abs(row[\"ret\"]) >= (limit - 0.005)\n\ndaily_data[\"limit_hit\"] = daily_data.apply(is_limit_hit, axis=1).astype(int)\n\nlimit_summary = (\n    daily_data\n    .groupby(\"relative_td\")[\"limit_hit\"]\n    .mean()\n    .reset_index()\n    .sort_values(\"relative_td\")\n)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ncolors = [\"firebrick\" if abs(t) <= 1 else \"steelblue\"\n          for t in limit_summary[\"relative_td\"]]\nax.bar(limit_summary[\"relative_td\"], limit_summary[\"limit_hit\"],\n       color=colors, edgecolor=\"white\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Trading Days Relative to Announcement\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Proportion Hitting Price Limit\")\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mticker.PercentFormatter(xmax=1, decimals=1))\nax.axvline(0, color=\"black\", linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.3)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Proportion of stocks hitting the daily price limit (within 0.5% of the ±7% HOSE limit or ±10% HNX limit) by event day.

Vietnam's position on these dimensions, developing institutional framework, VAS rather than IFRS, moderate transparency, suggests that announcement reactions may differ systematically from developed-market benchmarks.\n\nTheir framework generates a testable prediction: as Vietnam progresses toward IFRS adoption (a process underway as of 2025), the information content of earnings announcements should *increase* to the extent that IFRS improves the mapping from economic events to reported numbers.\n\n<!-- ## Exercises\n\n1.  **Median vs. mean.** Reproduce @fig-volatility-by-year and @fig-volume-by-year using the *median* rather than the mean across events on each event day. How do the results change? Which approach—mean or median—is more appropriate for drawing inferences, and why?\n\n2.  **Absolute returns.** Replace squared market-adjusted returns with *absolute* market-adjusted returns ($|R_{i,t} - R_{m,t}|$) as the volatility measure. This is the `mean_abs_ret` variable computed in the code. How do the plots and test statistics compare? What are the statistical advantages of absolute returns over squared returns?\n\n3.  **Pre-announcement drift.** Examine whether there is evidence of information leakage before the announcement. Specifically, test whether volume and volatility on days $\\{-5, -4, -3, -2\\}$ are significantly elevated above their non-event counterparts. What might explain pre-announcement trading activity in the Vietnamese context?\n\n4.  **Announcement day return direction.** @beaver1968information focused exclusively on *unsigned* measures (volume and volatility). Extend the analysis to examine whether the *sign* of the announcement-day return is predictable. Compute the fraction of announcements with positive market-adjusted returns on day 0. Test whether this fraction differs from 50%. What would a systematic positive (or negative) bias imply?\n\n5.  **Post-announcement drift.** Following the event study methodology from the previous chapter, compute cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) from day +2 to day +20 and test whether they are systematically nonzero. Post-announcement drift would suggest that the market underreacts to earnings news and gradually incorporates the information.\n\n6.  **Price limit effects.** Identify announcements where the stock hit the daily price limit on day 0. For these events, plot cumulative absolute market-adjusted returns from day 0 through day +5. Compare with events where no limit was hit. Does the multi-day adjustment pattern for limit-hit events suggest that price limits impede efficient information incorporation?\n\n7.  **Confounding events.** A potential threat to identification is that other corporate events (dividend declarations, M&A announcements, capital raisings) may coincide with the earnings window. If you have access to event data, exclude firm-windows with confounding events and re-estimate the analysis. How sensitive are the results to this filter?\n\n8.  **Asymmetric reactions.** Classify announcements into \"good news\" (positive market-adjusted return on day 0) and \"bad news\" (negative return). Compare the volume and volatility patterns separately for each group. Is there evidence that the market reacts more strongly to bad news, consistent with the \"bad news travels slowly\" hypothesis of @berkman2009price?\n\n9.  **Herd behavior.** @nguyen2014herd document herding behavior in Vietnamese equity markets. Design a test for whether announcement-day trading shows signs of herding (e.g., correlation between individual stock volume and market-wide volume conditional on the announcement signal). Discuss how herding would affect the interpretation of volume as a measure of information content.\n\n10. **Time trend in information content.** Vietnam's disclosure regime has strengthened over time (Circular 155/2015/TT-BTC, Decree 71/2017/NĐ-CP). Test whether the announcement-day volatility ratio has increased over your sample period. A formal test would regress the event-level volatility difference on a time trend. -->\n\n## Summary\n\nThis chapter examined whether earnings announcements convey new information to investors in Vietnamese equity markets, following the foundational research design of @beaver1968information. The key findings are:\n\n-   Both return volatility and trading volume spike sharply on the announcement day and the following day, providing robust evidence of information content. This result holds across fiscal years, consistent with earnings being a persistent source of new information.\n\n-   Formal statistical tests reject the null of no information content with high confidence, using both mean-based and proportion-based measures.\n\n-   Cross-sectional analysis reveals that the announcement reaction is stronger for smaller firms and HNX-listed firms, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the information content of earnings is inversely related to the richness of the pre-disclosure information environment.\n\n-   Vietnamese-specific features—price limits, retail dominance, and sparse analyst coverage—create distinctive empirical patterns that enrich the standard @beaver1968information framework. Price limits, in particular, generate multi-day adjustment dynamics that researchers must account for when measuring single-day information content.\n\n-   The @bamber2000we critique—that mean effects can be driven by outliers—is addressed by examining the proportion of events with above-median reactions, which still shows clear announcement-day elevation.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the conclusion that annual earnings announcements convey new information to the Vietnamese market, consistent with the original @beaver1968information findings and the broader international evidence in @landsman2012information.\n\n",

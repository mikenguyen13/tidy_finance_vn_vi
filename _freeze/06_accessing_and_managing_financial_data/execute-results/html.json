Everybody who has experience with data is also familiar with storing data in various formats like CSV, XLS, XLSX, or other delimited value storage. Reading and saving data can become very cumbersome when using different data formats and across different projects. Moreover, storing data in delimited files often leads to problems with respect to column type consistency. For instance, date-type columns frequently lead to inconsistencies across different data formats and programming languages. \n\nFirst, we load the Python packages that we use throughout this chapter. Later on, we load more packages in the sections where we need them. \n\n::: {#25497bcb .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport io\nimport re\nimport zipfile\nfrom curl_cffi import requests\n```\n:::\n\n\nMoreover, we initially define the date range for which we fetch and store the financial data, making future data updates tractable. In case you need another time frame, you can adjust the dates below. \n\n::: {#3fa5243f .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nstart_date = \"1960-01-01\"\nend_date = \"2024-12-31\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Macroeconomic Predictors\n\nOur next data source is a set of macroeconomic variables often used as predictors for the equity premium. @Goyal2008 comprehensively reexamine the performance of variables suggested by the academic literature to be good predictors of the equity premium. The authors host the data on [Amit Goyal's website.](https://sites.google.com/view/agoyal145) Since the data is an XLSX-file stored on a public Google Drive location, we need additional packages to access the data directly from our Python session. Usually, you need to authenticate if you interact with Google drive directly in Python. Since the data is stored via a public link, we can proceed without any authentication.\\index{Google Drive}\n\n::: {#061b25f9 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsheet_id = \"1bM7vCWd3WOt95Sf9qjLPZjoiafgF_8EG\"\nsheet_name = \"macro_predictors.xlsx\"\nmacro_predictors_link = (\n  f\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{sheet_id}\" \n  f\"/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet={sheet_name}\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we read in the new data and transform the columns into the variables that we later use:\n\n1. The dividend price ratio (`dp`), the difference between the log of dividends and the log of prices, where dividends are 12-month moving sums of dividends paid on the S&P 500 index, and prices are monthly averages of daily closing prices [@Campbell1988; @Campbell2006]. \n1. Dividend yield (`dy`), the difference between the log of dividends and the log of lagged prices [@Ball1978]. \n1. Earnings price ratio (`ep`), the difference between the log of earnings and the log of prices, where earnings are 12-month moving sums of earnings on the S&P 500 index [@Campbell1988]. \n1. Dividend payout ratio (`de`), the difference between the log of dividends and the log of earnings [@Lamont1998]. \n1. Stock variance (`svar`), the sum of squared daily returns on the S&P 500 index [@Guo2006].\n1. Book-to-market ratio (`bm`), the ratio of book value to market value for the Dow Jones Industrial Average [@Kothari1997].\n1. Net equity expansion (`ntis`), the ratio of 12-month moving sums of net issues by NYSE listed stocks divided by the total end-of-year market capitalization of NYSE stocks [@Campbell2008].\n1. Treasury bills (`tbl`), the 3-Month Treasury Bill: Secondary Market Rate from the economic research database at the Federal Reserve Bank at St. Louis [@Campbell1987].\n1. Long-term yield (`lty`), the long-term government bond yield from Ibbotson's Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Yearbook [@Goyal2008].\n1. Long-term rate of returns (`ltr`), the long-term government bond returns from Ibbotson's Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Yearbook [@Goyal2008].\n1. Term spread (`tms`), the difference between the long-term yield on government bonds and the Treasury bill [@Campbell1987].\n1. Default yield spread (`dfy`), the difference between BAA and AAA-rated corporate bond yields [@Fama1989]. \n1. Inflation (`infl`), the Consumer Price Index (All Urban Consumers) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [@Campbell2004].\n\t\t\t\nFor variable definitions and the required data transformations, you can consult the material on [Amit Goyal's website.](https://sites.google.com/view/agoyal145)\n\n::: {#b6e4a119 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context\n\nmacro_predictors = (\n  pd.read_csv(macro_predictors_link, thousands=\",\")\n  .assign(\n    date=lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x[\"yyyymm\"], format=\"%Y%m\"),\n    dp=lambda x: np.log(x[\"D12\"])-np.log(x[\"Index\"]),\n    dy=lambda x: np.log(x[\"D12\"])-np.log(x[\"Index\"].shift(1)),\n    ep=lambda x: np.log(x[\"E12\"])-np.log(x[\"Index\"]),\n    de=lambda x: np.log(x[\"D12\"])-np.log(x[\"E12\"]),\n    tms=lambda x: x[\"lty\"]-x[\"tbl\"],\n    dfy=lambda x: x[\"BAA\"]-x[\"AAA\"]\n  )\n  .rename(columns={\"b/m\": \"bm\"})\n  .get([\"date\", \"dp\", \"dy\", \"ep\", \"de\", \"svar\", \"bm\", \n        \"ntis\", \"tbl\", \"lty\", \"ltr\", \"tms\", \"dfy\", \"infl\"])\n  .query(\"date >= @start_date and date <= @end_date\")\n  .dropna()\n)\n\nssl._create_default_https_context = ssl.create_default_context\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Other Macroeconomic Data\n\nThe Federal Reserve bank of St. Louis provides the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), an extensive database for macroeconomic data. In total, there are 817,000 US and international time series from 108 different sources. As an illustration, we use the `tidyfinance` package to fetch consumer price index (CPI) data that can be found under the [CPIAUCNS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS) key.\\index{Data!FRED}\\index{Data!CPI}\n\n::: {#ffab7086 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nseries = \"CPIAUCNS\"\nurl = f\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id={series}\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then use the `requests` module to request the CSV, extract the data from the response body, and convert the columns to a tidy format:\n\n::: {#6e58a947 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nresp = requests.get(url)\nresp_csv = pd.io.common.StringIO(resp.text)\n\ncpi_monthly = (pd.read_csv(resp_csv)\n  .assign(\n    date=lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x[\"observation_date\"]),\n    value=lambda x: pd.to_numeric(\n      x[series], errors=\"coerce\"\n    ),\n      series=series,\n   )\n  .get([\"date\", \"series\", \"value\"])\n  .query(\"date >= @start_date & date <= @end_date\")\n  .assign(cpi=lambda x: x[\"value\"] / x[\"value\"].iloc[-1])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe last line sets the current (latest) price level as the reference price level.\n\nTo download other time series, we just have to look it up on the FRED website and extract the corresponding key from the address. For instance, the producer price index for gold ores can be found under the [PCU2122212122210](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU2122212122210) key. If your desired time series is not supported through tidyfinance, we recommend working with the `fredapi` package. Note that you need to get an API key to use its functionality. We refer to the package documentation for details.\n\n## Setting Up a Database\n\nNow that we have downloaded some (freely available) data from the web into the memory of our Python session, let us set up a database to store that information for future use. We will use the data stored in this database throughout the following chapters, but you could alternatively implement a different strategy and replace the respective code. \n\nThere are many ways to set up and organize a database, depending on the use case. For our purpose, the most efficient way is to use an [SQLite](https://SQLite.org/)-database, which is the C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured SQL database engine. Note that [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.\\index{Database!SQLite}\n\n::: {#f21dd8df .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport sqlite3\n```\n:::\n\n\nAn SQLite-database is easily created - the code below is really all there is. You do not need any external software. Otherwise, date columns are stored and retrieved as integers.\\index{Database!Creation} We will use the file `tidy_finance_r.sqlite`, located in the data subfolder, to retrieve data for all subsequent chapters. The initial part of the code ensures that the directory is created if it does not already exist.\n\n::: {#a36dfd89 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport os\n\nif not os.path.exists(\"data\"):\n  os.makedirs(\"data\")\n    \ntidy_finance = sqlite3.connect(database=\"data/tidy_finance_python.sqlite\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we create a remote table with the monthly Fama-French factor data. We do so with the `pandas` function `to_sql()`, which copies the data to our SQLite-database.\n\n::: {#0f33cfcc .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n(factors_ff3_monthly\n  .to_sql(name=\"factors_ff3_monthly\", \n          con=tidy_finance, \n          if_exists=\"replace\",\n          index=False)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, if we want to have the whole table in memory, we need to call `pd.read_sql_query()` with the corresponding query. You will see that we regularly load the data into the memory in the next chapters.\\index{Database!Read}\n\n::: {#4dd19f64 .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npd.read_sql_query(\n  sql=\"SELECT date, risk_free FROM factors_ff3_monthly\",\n  con=tidy_finance,\n  parse_dates={\"date\"}\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe last couple of code chunks are really all there is to organizing a simple database! You can also share the SQLite database across devices and programming languages. \n\nBefore we move on to the next data source, let us also store the other six tables in our new SQLite database. \n\n::: {#627b9db7 .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndata_dict = {\n  \"factors_ff5_monthly\": factors_ff5_monthly,\n  \"factors_ff3_daily\": factors_ff3_daily,\n  \"industries_ff_monthly\": industries_ff_monthly, \n  \"factors_q_monthly\": factors_q_monthly,\n  \"macro_predictors\": macro_predictors,\n  \"cpi_monthly\": cpi_monthly\n}\n\nfor key, value in data_dict.items():\n    value.to_sql(name=key,\n                 con=tidy_finance, \n                 if_exists=\"replace\",\n                 index=False)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFrom now on, all you need to do to access data that is stored in the database is to follow two steps: (i) Establish the connection to the SQLite-database and (ii) execute the query to fetch the data. For your convenience, the following steps show all you need in a compact fashion.\\index{Database!Connection}\n\n::: {#da1f1c3c .cell message='false' results='false' execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3\n\ntidy_finance = sqlite3.connect(database=\"data/tidy_finance_python.sqlite\")\n\nfactors_q_monthly = pd.read_sql_query(\n  sql=\"SELECT * FROM factors_q_monthly\",\n  con=tidy_finance,\n  parse_dates={\"date\"}\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Managing SQLite Databases\n\nFinally, at the end of our data chapter, we revisit the  SQLite database itself. When you drop database objects such as tables or delete data from tables, the database file size remains unchanged because SQLite just marks the deleted objects as free and reserves their space for future uses. As a result, the database file always grows in size.\\index{Database!Management}\n\nTo optimize the database file, you can run the `VACUUM` command in the database, which rebuilds the database and frees up unused space. You can execute the command in the database using the `execute()` function. \n\n::: {#a2159f79 .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntidy_finance.execute(\"VACUUM\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `VACUUM` command actually performs a couple of additional cleaning steps, which you can read about in [this tutorial.](https://SQLite.org/docs/sql/statements/vacuum.html) \\index{Database!Cleaning}\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Importing Fama-French factors, q-factors, macroeconomic indicators, and CPI data is simplified through API calls, CSV parsing, and web scraping techniques.\n- The `tidyfinance` Python package offers pre-processed access to financial datasets, reducing manual data cleaning and saving valuable time.\n- Creating a centralized SQLite database helps manage and organize data efficiently across projects, while maintaining reproducibility.\n- Structured database storage supports scalable data access, which is essential for long-term academic projects and collaborative work in finance.\n\n",
